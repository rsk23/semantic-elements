      <h1>HTML5 100 - Homework assignment #1</h1>
      <h2>My paragraph summary of what semantic elements are:</h2>
      <p>Semantic elements are a newly defined set of elements available in the html 5 standard. The names for these elements
      were dervived from analysis of the most commonly used ids associated with the div and span elements, and provide for
      a much more "natual language" feel to programming. That is to say, creating an html page in html5 feels
      considerably more like assembling the elements of a newspaper than creating an html page in html4 (or less).<br>
      A core tenant of the html5 philosophy appears to be that html is all about organization of conent, whereas CSS
      is about styling. I am excited to develop a more complete understanding of this distinction.</p>
